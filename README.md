Bacon.js slides
===============

Just converting my RxJs slides to use Bacon.js to see if that can be
done. Was done in no time and I think it looks better with bacon. The
slides can be conveniently viewed at [http://raimohanska.github.com/bacon.js-slides] (http://raimohanska.github.com/bacon.js-slides).
